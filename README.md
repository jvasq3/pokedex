## Setup

#### 
node version: 18

In root:

`npm install`

`npm start`

## Pending

Some store enhancements would enable text field updates when searching pokemon history. I would also implement error states for not found pokemon and proper input validation of characters. Given more time, I would also implement separate UI for loading pokemon details. Some setup has been done for a loading state which was also not yet implemented. Testing was an afterthought as well with the time constraints, but I would have tested hooks, comopnent, and redux logic.
